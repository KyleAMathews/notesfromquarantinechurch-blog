# Hi

This is a test. And I like it

  - Nephi has died & Jacob becomes the spiritual leader
  - it's not really clear who the political successor is â€” the [[Book of Mormon]] just says "Wherefore, he anointed a man to be a king and a ruler over his people now". It's pretty curious that the person wasn't named.
  - Given that spiritual & political succession in the [[Book of Mormon]] normally goes to a son, this implies Nephi either had no sons or that none were worthy (e.g. went with Lamenintes)
  - This article speculates it was Sam who became the second king as Lehi's blessing & other clues indicates that Sam and his descendents were counted as part of Nephi's "tribe" https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.5406/dialjmormthou.42.4.0001.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A030a5c0a41796f0295e9266a478dca74
- 1:7-8 â€” classic Christian teaching â€” believe so not shut out of after life. Or actually ðŸ¤”"enter into his rest" implies this life as well
 - One of my favorite scriptures touches on this:
 - Doctrine and Covenants 59:23

   But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come. #quotes
     - we can have peace, be at rest â€” even with all the potentially crazy things that happen during our lives.
    - I like this too as there's little else that's for sure promised us during this life. We might, like [[Bible Figure/Job]] lose everything.
 - Jacob 2
                        - Jacob is hurting â€” wonder what triggered his spike in anxiety. Presumably the extra marriages had been happening for a while? Perhaps someone prominent gave them support so he sensed the tide was shifting
                        - 18-19: "But before you seek for riches, seek ye the kingdom of God.

And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do goodâ€”to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted." #quotes classic scriptures
                        - 21: "And all flesh is of the dust; and for the selfsame end hath he created them, that they should keep his commandments and glorify him forever." #quotes
                            - he created us to help us grow â€” [[Commandments are [[mental models]] to help us gain [[intelligence]]]]
                            - we "glorify" him by gaining in intelligence
                        - 22 â€” now he speaks of a "grosser crime" than pride & riches seeking â€” "whoredoms" & seeking multiple wives
                        - Jacob 2:35

Behold, ye have done greater iniquities than the Lamanites, our brethren. ^^Ye have **broken the hearts of your tender wives, and lost the confidence of your children,** because of your bad examples before them; and the sobbings of their hearts ascend up to God against you.^^ And because of the strictness of the word of God, which cometh down against you, many hearts died, pierced with deep wounds. #quotes
